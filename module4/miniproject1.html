                        Veale Auto Parts is Proudly Western Australian Owned and Operated.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>In 1962 shortly after finishing his Automotive Apprenticeship and coupled with a passion for cars and racing, Terry Veale leased the BP Theatre Service Station in South Bunbury. 
                    This proved to be a very successful business covering servicing and maintenance on all vehicles and specializing in Holdens.
                    Since that humble beginning and coupled with Terry's desire and drive for success, Veale Auto Parts was born in 1990.
                    
                </p>
                <p>Veale Auto Parts is now the preferred trade supplier of automotive spare parts in Western Australia. With 17 stores over the Perth metropolitan area from Joondalup in the north and as far south as Bunbury.
                    We are continually expanding our stock range to further assist our customers. We carry a massive range of over 160000 line items of automotive parts including many hard to find parts.
