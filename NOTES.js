primitive data type:

is a variable that stores a single value, Examples include numbers (with and without decimals), strings and booleans.
They take up very little space in memory and are efficient and useful for storing
data in many simple cases.

complex 



objects are more structured (as a table of contents)

arrays stores more than one value in a single variable, and they are like a shopping list


A database is an organised collection of structured information in a computer system. 
data is most commonly used with rows and columns to make processing and data querying efficient.
The data can then be accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled and organised.
